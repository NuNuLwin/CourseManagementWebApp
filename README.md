# About The Project

## Course Management Platform

The Course Management Platform is a web application that helps course instructors
and students interact with courses more effectively online, anywhere and anytime.
It allows a course instructor to create a course, register students in the course and upload course content for students. For students, they are able to view the courses’ details in which they are registered and access the course content.
